# Pandas_library

# Case study where my objective was to use the Pandas library functions and visualize this data through the Matplotlib and Plotly libraries.

#The Dataset Varejo that we have in our hands is composed for sell informations of a virtual store that operates in all national territory, selling productos of differents departaments. Fuuthermore, the store operates in different sells channels like marketplace, Apps, own store, etc.

Business premises:
When analyzing the data, it is important to keep in mind that there are some business assumptions that should be considered. The first is that, due to an error in the system, some purchases do not have UF (Federative Unit) information. To solve this problem, it was decided that these purchases will be considered as belonging to the state of Mato Grosso do Sul (MS). The second premise is that the final price cannot be higher than the price including shipping.

Metrics:
Based on this context and the established business assumptions, we can evaluate the following metrics:

1. Best-selling departments: By analyzing sales data, we can identify which departments are most popular among customers. This information can be useful in understanding which products are most sought after by customers and adjusting the store's sales strategy accordingly.
2. Average shipping price by department name: To understand price behavior by department, we can calculate the average shipping price by department name. This methodology can help identify which departments are the most profitable and adjust product pricing according to the desired margin.
3. Number of sales per month: by analyzing the number of sales made each month, we can identify seasonalities in behavior and plan specific marketing campaigns for each period.
4. Average income for each type of sales channel: Identifying the average income of customers in different sales channels can help the store choose the marketing and sales strategy for each target audience.
5. Average age of customers by brand: Knowing the age range of customers by brand can help identify consumer profiles and adjust sales to better serve each audience.
